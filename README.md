# Multifaceted Machine Learning: Comprehensive Analysis Across Diverse Datasets

## Project Overview
This project, part of the EEE549: Statistical Machine Learning course, presents a thorough application of various machine learning models to three distinct datasets: UCI Adult, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, and Fashion MNIST. The project demonstrates the versatility and efficacy of different algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM, PCA+k-NN, and FNN/CNN, in tackling classification tasks across these datasets.

## Datasets
1. **UCI Adult Dataset**: Used for predicting whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.
2. **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**: Utilized for classification of cancer as benign or malignant.
3. **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: Employed for identifying fashion products from a set of grayscale images.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Principal Component Analysis with k-Nearest Neighbors (PCA+k-NN)
- Feedforward Neural Networks/Convolutional Neural Networks (FNN/CNN)

## Key Features
- **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning for each model to optimize performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Detailed analysis using plots and classification metrics.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Versatile approaches across different datasets highlighting the adaptability of machine learning algorithms.
